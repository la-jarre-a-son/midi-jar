As you might know, Harbor Type is a one-man type foundry. By respecting these terms, you’ll help me make a living out of this, and in turn I’ll be able to keep designing fonts. This also means that, if you are unsure about any of the points above, just get in touch at ahoy@harbortype.com and I’ll be happy to help you.
